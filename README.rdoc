# Eagle Scout Project Locator

### GA WDI DC July 2014, Individual Final Project

### Overview

**Eagle Scout Project Locator** is a recreational web application designed to encourage Eagle Scouts to add their projects to the app. It can also be used for potential Eagle Scouts to gain inspiration for a potential project. It was developed as a sample Rails project for my April 2014 Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in Washington, DC. It was developed over a 5 day sprint.
